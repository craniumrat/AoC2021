# AoC2021
For the past couple of years, I have been trying to do advent of code to learn a new language. Turns out Haskell and Rust are hard if you are not working on them on a regular basis. So this year, I will be getting back to my basics in a sense and definitely a new way of programming. So I will be doing C++ - 2020 in MSVC.
