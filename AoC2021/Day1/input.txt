A solution of such an equation is a n-tuples such that substituting each element of the tuple for the corresponding 
variable transforms the equation into a true equality.
For an equation to be meaningful, the coefficient of at least one 
variable must be non-zero. In fact, if every variable has a zero coefficient
, then, as mentioned for one variable, the equation 
is either inconsistent (for b = 0) as having no solution, or all 
n-tuples are solutions.
